# GitHub markdown Practice
Today I learend git-markdown format at [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
## Text
- Bold: Wrap the text with a pair of **; **This is my first TIL with gitHub md**
- Italic: Wrap the text with a pair of *; *I'll make TIL everyday if I can*
- Link: Wrap the text which leads to address with [] and write the address at the end of brackets inside (); This is my [TIL](https://github.com/gudwns0102/TIL/) 

## Lists

Each markdown has property of sublist. The syntax is exactly same as below and just use following 2 spaces to denote sublist section

- ol: You can list nubered list by denoting '#.' at the first of each items like '1. TIL'.

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
 
- bullet points: You can also use * to list items with bullet point. 
* one
* Two
* Three
  
- bullet points: Use dash(-) to list items with bullet point. 
- one
- two
- three

- sublist demo: 

  1. ol
  * bullet point
  - dash

## Image
syntax: \!\[Image of Yaktocat\](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

## Quotes
Use \> at the start of text to make the text as quotes 
> There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.
> Ernest Hemingway

## Codes
There are many ways to make code block.
You can use \` \` to make short code block like `var str = 'Hello World!'`,
or wrap the code with a pair of ```
```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

## Conclusion
There are tricky way to use md but it is not matched with the philosophy of md I guess. The markdown language pursues simple usage. 
I think above usages are enough and I'll add more features if I need
